ReadMe

This respository contains all of the processing scripts and a few of the model configuration files used in the various modelling efforts conducted for my PhD. They are broken down by the particular modelling endeavour for which they were used. Separate ReadMe files will describe the contents of each folder.

Regrettably, the data from my PhD is not available in this repository, since there is about 15 GB of data. However, it has been made available on the University of Bristol's data repository. To gain access, please contact the data steward for my PhD's folders on the university's repository, Professor Lucy Berthoud, by emailing Lucy.Berthoud@bristol.ac.uk

Thank you for reading!
